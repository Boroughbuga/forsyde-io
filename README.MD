# ForSyDe Meta

This repository holds the component model interpretation for the ForSyDe methodology so that code can easily be generated and managed for different programming languages.

Pragmatically, the "meta-model" is described in Ecore, the core part of the Eclipse Modelling Framework. For generation, the Epsilon framework is used as to make all the code as independent as possible from either Ecore or Epsilon while also trying to express them as naturally as possible in each target language.
